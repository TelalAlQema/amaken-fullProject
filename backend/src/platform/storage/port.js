/**
 * The storage port.
 *
 * This file is an **interface, not an implementation**. It exists so that M05
 * (queue-based export) and M06 (dashboard cache) write against `platform/storage`
 * and never against `node:fs`, and so the S3 adapter can land later without a
 * call-site change.
 *
 * ## Why this is the hard single-replica blocker
 *
 * `backend/public/uploads` is local disk. Replica B serves nothing that replica A
 * wrote: every avatar, logo, team photo, about image and property image written
 * to A 404s on B. No queue, no cache and no shared database changes that — it is
 * a shared-nothing filesystem.
 *
 * **Until an S3 adapter implements this port, the API must run as exactly one
 * replica.** See `docs/runbook.md` § *Deployment constraint: single replica* for
 * the exit path. The queue and the cache going shared does not relax this.
 *
 * ## The interface
 *
 * Adapters implement:
 *
 *   put(key, buffer, { contentType, dir })  → { key, size, contentType }
 *   get(key)                                → Buffer | null
 *   delete(key)                             → boolean
 *   exists(key)                             → boolean
 *   url(key, { absolute })                  → string   (absolute needs a base)
 *   list(dir)                               → [{ key, size, modifiedAt }]
 *   readStream(key)                         → Readable | null
 *   health()                                → { ok, adapter, detail? }
 *   close()                                 → Promise<void>
 *
 * `dir` is a logical directory such as `"properties"` or `"team"`, not a
 * filesystem path. It is joined into `key` by the adapter and never
 * concatenated into a real path by a caller — that is what makes the interface
 * path-traversal-proof by construction.

/**
 * Logical directories the application uses. Not filesystem paths.
 *
 * `USERS` is the odd one out and is named that way deliberately. It is not a
 * category — it is the directory the pre-M02 code wrote *every* non-property
 * image into: profile avatars, company logos, team photos and about images all
 * share `public/uploads/users/`, and the database rows holding those filenames
 * are addressed by callers that rebuild the path themselves
 * (`getUserUploadDir()` in `services/upload.service.js`, used from
 * `user.service.js` and `admin.service.js`).
 *
 * Renaming the directory to `avatars` — which reads better and is what the other
 * entries are named for — would write new files somewhere the read path does not
 * look, so an image would 404 immediately after a successful upload. Directory
 * names are part of the persisted contract until every row is migrated. When
 * `AVATARS`/`LOGOS`/`TEAM`/`ABOUT` are actually used, they need a data migration
 * in the same change.
